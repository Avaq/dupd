dupd is a file duplicate detection CLI utility.

The build currently supports Linux (tested on Debian), Solaris (tested
on OpenIndiana) and Mac OS X. Other UNIX variants should work with
minimal changes.

dupd seeks to be fast and efficient. For most file sets it performs
better than popular tools such as 'fdupes'.

Quick howto:

% dupd scan --path $HOME   (or whichever path you want to scan)
% dupd report
