dupd is a file duplicate detection CLI utility.

The build currently supports Linux, Solaris, OS X and OpenBSD.  Other
UNIX variants should work with minimal effort. See BUILDING file for
notes on building dupd.

dupd seeks to be fast and efficient. For most file sets it performs
better than popular tools such as 'fdupes'.
