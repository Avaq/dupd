dupd is a duplicate file finder CLI utility.

dupd enables an exploratory approach to finding duplicates in your
filesystems instead of only showing a static list of duplicate
files. See the docs directory for more information and examples.

dupd also seeks to be fast. For most file sets it performs better than
other popular tools.

The build currently supports Linux, Solaris, OS X, OpenBSD and
FreeBSD.  Other UNIX variants should work with minimal effort. See
the BUILDING file for notes on building dupd.
