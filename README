dupd is a file duplicate detection CLI utility.

The build currently supports Linux, Solaris, OS X, OpenBSD and
FreeBSD.  Other UNIX variants should work with minimal effort. See
BUILDING file for notes on building dupd.

dupd seeks to be fast and efficient. For most file sets it performs
better than other popular tools.
