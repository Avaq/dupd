Dependencies
------------
dupd requires SQLite (-lsqlite3) and OpenSSL (-lcrypto).

Note that dupd no longer requires libbloom.

Building
--------
The Makefile specifically supports Linux, SunOS, Darwin (OS X) and OpenBSD.
If you build on other platforms, let me know.

The Makefile assumes GNU make. To build just run make (or gmake).

If you'd like to test your built binary run "make test".

There are other targets in the Makefile which you won't need unless
you want to hack on the code. See Makefile in that case.


Installing
----------
There is no install target as the dupd binary is fully self-contained.
Just copy it wherever you like (e.g. $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin).

Copy the man page (man/dupd.1) to the corresponding location if you wish.
(e.g. $HOME/man/man1/ or /usr/local/man/man1/). The same man page content is
also available from dupd itself by running 'dupd man'.
