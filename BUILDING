Dependencies
------------
dupd depends on libbloom (https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom).

By default the build expects to find libbloom as a peer directory to dupd.
If dupd is in $HOME/src/dupd/ then clone libbloom into $HOME/src/libbloom/

You can override this location assumption by setting LIBBLOOM_INC and
LIBBLOOM_LIB, see Makefile. Build libbloom before building dupd.

Aside from that, dupd requires SQLite (-lsqlite3) and OpenSSL (-lcrypto).


Building
--------
The Makefile specifically supports Linux, SunOS, Darwin and OpenBSD.
If you build on other platforms, let me know.

The Makefile assumes GNU make. To build just run make (or gmake).

If you'd like to test your built binary run "make test".

There are other targets in the Makefile which you won't need unless
you want to hack on the code. See Makefile in that case.


Installing
----------
There is no install target as the dupd binary is fully self-contained.
Just copy it wherever you like (e.g. $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin).
