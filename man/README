dupd.1 is a man page for dupd suitable for installing wherever your
distribution installs man page sources.

dupd is a rendering of dupd.1 into plain text for the benefit of
online viewing (https://github.com/jvirkki/dupd/blob/master/man/dupd).
This is also the copy which is embedded into dupd (see 'dupd man').
It is generated from dupd.1 with 'make man'.
